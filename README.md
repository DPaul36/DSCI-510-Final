# DSCI-510-Final
 Final Project DSCI 510
@Author David Paul
Welcome to my final project for DSCI-510. The code for this project is contained in the modules "Code_Functions.py", "Batting_Plots.py", and "Pitching_Plots.py". In order to run the project, the following packages are required. 
//
-pumpy
-pandas
-baseball_scraper //

Versions for these packages are given in requirements.txt
The folders Data, Data_ROB, and Data_pitch, as well as the code modules ,need to be in the same file location as Report.ipynb.
To run this project, open Report.ipynb and run all cells, though the visualizations should not change from the default in the report.
